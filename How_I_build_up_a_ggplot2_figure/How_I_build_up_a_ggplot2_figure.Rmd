Recently, Jeff Leek at Simply Statistics discussed [why he does not use ggplot2](http://simplystatistics.org/2016/02/11/why-i-dont-use-ggplot2/).  He notes "The bottom line is for production graphics, any system requires work." and describes a default plot that needs some work:
```{r plot}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = quakes, aes(x = lat,y = long,colour = stations)) + geom_point()
```

To break down what is going on, here is what R interprets (more or less):

1.  Make a container for data `ggplot`.
2.  Use the `quakes` `data.frame`: `data = quakes`.
3.  Map certain "aesthetics" with the `aes` to three different aesthetics (`x`, `y`, `z`) to certain variables from the dataset `lat`, `long`, `stations`, respectively.
4.  Add a layer of geometric things, in this case points (`geom_point`).

Implicitly, `ggplot2` notes that all 3 aesthetics are continuous, so maps them onto the plot using a  "continuous" scale (color bar).  If `stations` were a factor or character column, the plot would not have a color bar but a "discrete" scale.  


Now, Jeff goes on to describe elemnts he believes required to make this plot "production ready":

1. make the axes bigger
2. make the labels bigger
3. make the labels be full names (latitude and longitude, ideally with units when variables need them
4. make the legend title be number of stations reporting

As such, I wanted to go through each step and show how you can do each of these operations

## Make the Axes/Labels Bigger
First off, let's assign this plot to an object, called `g`:
```{r save_plot}
g = ggplot(data = quakes, 
           aes(x = lat,y = long,colour = stations)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Now, you can simply call `print(g)` to show the plot, but the assignment will not do that by default.  If you simply call `g`, it will print/show the object (as other R objects do), and plot the graph.

### Theme - get to know it
One of the most useful `ggplot2` functions is `theme`.   Read the documentation (`?theme`).  There is a slew of options, but we will use a few of them for this and expand on them in the next sections.

### Setting a global text size
We can use the `text` argument to change **ALL** the text sizes to a value.  Now this is where users who have never used `ggplot2` may be a bit confused.  The `text` argument (input) in the `theme` command requires that `text` be an object of class `element_text`.  If you look at the `theme` help it says "`all text elements (element_text)`".  This means you can't just say `text = 5`, you must specify `text = element_text()`.  

As text can have multiple properties (`size`, `color`, etc.), `element_text` can take multiple arguments for these properties.   One of these arguments is `size`:
```{r bigger_axis}
g + theme(text = element_text(size = 20))
```

Again, note that the `text` argument/property of theme changes all the text sizes.  Let's say we want to change the axis tick text (`axis.text`), legend header/title (`legend.title`), legend key text (`legend.text`), and axis label text (`axis.title`) to each a different size:

```{r bigger_axis2}
gbig = g + theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 18),
                 axis.title = element_text(size = 20),
                 legend.text = element_text(size = 15),
                 legend.title = element_text(size = 15))
gbig
```

Now, we still have the plot `g` stored, but we make a new version of the graph, called `gbig`.


## Make the Labels to be full names
To change the x or y labels, you can just use the `xlab`/`ylab` functions:

```{r lab_full}
gbig = gbig + xlab("Latitude") + ylab("Longitude")
gbig
```

We want to keep these labels, so we overwrote `gbig`. 

### Maybe add a title
Now, one may assume there is a `main()` function from `ggplot2` to give the title of the graph, but that function is `ggtitle()`.  Note, there is a `title` command in `base` R, so this was not overwritten.  It can be used by just adding this layer:

```{r title}
gbig + ggtitle("Spatial Distribution of Stations")
```

Note, the title is smaller than the specified axes label sizes by default.  Again if we wanted to make that title bigger, we can change that using `theme`:
```{r big_title}
gbig +
  ggtitle("Spatial Distribution of Stations") + 
  theme(title = element_text(size = 30))
```

I will not reassign this to a new graph as in some figures for publications, you make the title in the figure legend and not the graph itself.

## Making a better legend
Now let's change the header/title of the legend to be number of stations.  We can do this using the `guides` function:
```{r leg}
gbigleg_orig = gbig + guides(colour = guide_colorbar(title = "Number of Stations Reporting"))
gbigleg_orig
```

Here, `guides` takes arguments that are the same as the aesthetics from before in `aes`.  Also note, that `color` and `colour` are aliased so that you can spell it either way you want.  

I like the size of the title, but I don't like how wide it is. We can put line breaks in there as well:
```{r leg2}
gbigleg = gbig + guides(colour = guide_colorbar(title = "Number\nof\nStations\nReporting"))
gbigleg
```

Ugh, let's also adjust the horizontal justification, so the title is centered:
```{r leg_adjust}
gbigleg = gbigleg + 
  guides(colour = guide_colorbar(title = "Number\nof\nStations\nReporting",
                                 title.hjust = 0.5))
gbigleg
```

That looks better for the legend, but we still have a lot of wasted space. 

## Legend IN the plot
One of the things I believe is that the legend should be **inside** the plot.  In order to do this, we can use the `legend.position` from the themes:

```{r leg_inside}
gbigleg + 
  theme(legend.position = c(0.3, 0.35))
```

Now, there seems can be a few problems here:

1.  There may not be enough place to put the legend
2.  The legend may mask out points/data

For problem 1., we can either 1) make the y-axis bigger or the legend smaller or a combination of both.  In this case, we do not have to change the axes, but you can use `ylim` to change the y-axis limits:

```{r change_ylim}
gbigleg +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.3, 0.35)) +
  ylim(c(160, max(quakes$long)))
```

I try to not do this as area has been added with no data information.  We have enough space, but let's make the legend "transparent" so we can at least see if any points are masked out and to make the legend look a more inclusive part of the plot.

### Making a transparent legend

I have a helper "function" `transparent_legend` that will make the box around the legend (`legend.background`) transparent and the boxes around the keys (`legend.key`) transparent as well.  Like `text` before, we have to specify boxes/backgrounds as an `element` type, but these are rectangles (`element_rect`) compared to text (`element_text`). 

```{r trans_leg}
transparent_legend =  theme(
  legend.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent"),
  legend.key = element_rect(fill = "transparent", 
                            color = "transparent")
)
```

One nice thing is that we can save this as an object and simply "add" it to any plot we want a transparent legend.  Let's add this to what we had and see the result:
```{r leg_inside2}
gtrans_leg = gbigleg + 
  theme(legend.position = c(0.3, 0.35)) +
  transparent_legend
gtrans_leg
```

### Moving the title of the legend
Now, everything in `gtrans_leg` looks acceptable (to me) except for the legend title.  We can move the title of the legend to the left hand side:

```{r leg_left}
gtrans_leg + guides(colour = guide_colorbar(title.position = "left"))
```

Damnit!  Note, that if you **respecify** the guides, you must make sure you do it all in one shot (easiest way):
```{r leg_left_correct}
gtrans_leg + guides(
  colour = guide_colorbar(title = "Number\nof\nStations\nReporting",
                          title.hjust = 0.5,
                          title.position = "left"))
```

#### A little more advanced
The last statement is not entirely true, as we could dig into the `ggplot2` object and assign a different `title.position` property to the object after the fact.

```{r respec}
gtrans_leg$guides$colour$title.position = "left"
gtrans_leg
```

### "I don't like that theme"
Many times, I have heard people who like the grammar of `ggplot2` but not the specified theme that is default.  The `ggthemes` package has some good extensions of theme from `ggplot2`, but there are also a bunch of themes included in `ggplot2`, which should be specified before changing specific elements of `theme` as done above:

```{r themes}
g + theme_bw()
g + theme_dark()
g + theme_minimal()
g + theme_classic()
```

## Conclusions
I agree that `ggplot2` can deceive new users by making graphs that look "good"-ish.  This may be a detriment as they may believe they are good enough, when they truly need to be changed.  The changes are available in `base` or `ggplot2` and the overall goal was to show how the recommendations can be achieved using `ggplot2` commands.  

Below, I discuss some other aspects of the post, where you can use `ggplot2` to make quick-ish exploratory plots.  I believe, however, that `ggplot2` is not the fastest for quick basic exploratory plots.  What is is better than `base` graphics is for making slightly more complex exploratory plots that are necessary for analysis, where `base` can take more code to do.



### How to make quick exploratory plots
I agree with Jeff that the purpose of exploratory plots should be done **quickly** and a broad range of plots done with **minimal code**. 

Now, I agree that `plot` is a great function.   I do believe that you can create many quick plots using `ggplot2` and can be faster than base in some instances.  A specific case would be that you have a binary `y` variable and multiple continous `x` variables.  Let's say I want to plot jittered points, a fit from a binomial `glm` (logistic regression), and one from a `loess`.  


Here we will use `mtcars` and say if the car is American or foreign (`am` variable) is our outcome.

```{r}
g = ggplot(aes(y = am), data = mtcars) + 
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(height = 0.2)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "glm", 
              method.args = list(family = "binomial"), se = FALSE) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, col = "red")
```

Then we can simply add the `x` variables as aesthetics to look at each of these:
```{r}
g + aes(x = mpg)
g + aes(x = drat)
g + aes(x = qsec)
```

Yes, you can create a function to do the operations above in base, but that's 2 sides of the same coin: function versus `ggplot2` object.
