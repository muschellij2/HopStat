<h1>My first package on CRAN</h1>

<p>Recently, I submitted a <a href="http://works.bepress.com/john_muschelli/3/">paper</a> to the <a href="http://journal.r-project.org/">R Journal</a>.  I had a repository (&ldquo;repo&rdquo;) on GitHub for it and the editor said that R Journal tries to only accept CRAN packages.  After classes and holidays, I finally got it <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brainR/index.html">accepted</a>.  I&#39;ll post about that package later, but I wanted to talk about some of the ins and outs I noticed that may have been helpful.</p>

<p>First things first.</p>

<p><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html">Writing R Extensions</a> is <em>THE</em> manual for doing this.  It answers almost every question you have.  Use it.  CRAN has its own <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html">POLICIES</a>.  Read them, they are necessary.</p>

<p>The CRAN team is amazing.  Granted, if you don&#39;t read the documentation, you will receive some rightfully-curt emails saying you didn&#39;t do X,Y,Z as I did.  Preparation is good before going to the show with your package.</p>

<h3>Things I recommend</h3>

<ul>
<li>Use <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hadley/devtools"><code>devtools</code></a>.  They make things much easier.  Go to <code>File -&gt; New Project</code> and make a git repository.  This creates a <code>.rproj</code> file that allows you to start a separate RStudio session, that has some fun options.</li>
<li>Use a git repository.  I&#39;d suggest either <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a>.  BitBucket allows private repositories for free with a .edu email, but GitHub is more popular.  Either way, you&#39;re developing software, so do some version control.  Also, and put it online so it&#39;s backed up and people can use it and install it either using <code>install_github</code> or <code>install_bitbucket</code> from <code>devtools</code>.</li>
<li>Use <a href="http://roxygen.org/">roxygen</a> for documentation.  You have code and documentation in the same and it makes things so much easier.  Period.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>Now you have <code>devtools</code> and a new project in RStudio, then go into your project and go to <code>Build -&gt; Configure Build Tools...</code> and add <code>--as-cran</code> to <code>Check Package</code> and check <code>Generate documentation with Roxygen</code>.  Then go to <code>Configure...</code> next to that checkbox and I&#39;d check all the boxes. </p>

<p>Almost all of this is explained as well from <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/packages/overview">Developing Packages with RStudio</a>.  You will only see this link in the RStudio application after you set up the project though, which seems odd.  </p>

<p>Also, if you created an online git repository, go to Git/SVN and make sure it&#39;s there.  Again, <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/version_control/overview?version=0.98.490&amp;mode=desktop">RStudio has documentation on this</a>, but this is viewable under preferences if you&#39;re not in a project.</p>

<h3>Submitting to CRAN</h3>

<p>Now, obviously you have to write the documentation and functions in your <code>R</code> package.  But when you submit to CRAN, here are some suggestions.</p>

<p>A few notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <code>inconsolata</code> package was a hassle and caused warnings with the PDF See <a href="http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/While-using-R-CMD-check-LaTex-error-File-inconsolata-sty-not-found-td4671431.html">this</a> and <a href="http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/inconsolata-sty-is-liable-to-disappear-texinfo-5-1-td4669976.html">this</a> for better ways to fix this.
I fixed this by using option 2, but you can fix this 1 of 2 ways (Mac/Unix):

<ul>
<li>Copy zi4.sty to inconsolata.sty in the inconsolata package.  For me, this was in &ldquo;/usr/local/texlive/2013/texmf-dist/tex/latex/inconsolata&rdquo;, which is user-dependent and which year they have MacTeX installed.  MikTeX for Windows will be in a different directory.</li>
<li>Copy zi4.sty to inconsolata.sty and move this this in &ldquo;/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local&rdquo;. 
The first option will work, but only for this version of TeX (which hopefully is fixed by the next iteration).  It may be preferred if you a) don&#39;t like local texmf directories, b) don&#39;t want to change your PATH to have these local directories or c) have no idea what I&#39;m talking about.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Make sure you turn off HTML emails.  In Gmail, on the bottom right corner, there is a down arrow, that allows you enable &ldquo;plain text&rdquo;.  Don&#39;t send HTML emails to CRAN (they don&#39;t like that).</li>
<li>Look here for submitting <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-check-your-package-with-r-devel/">http://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-check-your-package-with-r-devel/</a>.  Download the <code>R</code>-development branch <a href="http://r.research.att.com/">http://r.research.att.com/</a> and <code>Rswitch</code> as recommended.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, once you get the functions and package made (hard part), you should take some time to sit and read the submission process.  It&#39;ll save you time later.  Also, setting up the build options to be like CRAN from the beginning will have you poised to field more problems.</p>
