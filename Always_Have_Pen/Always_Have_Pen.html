<h1>Always Have a Pen</h1>

<p>So a few know that I have a set of rules that I have made over the years that are some good guidelines for my life.  Some of them are not appropriate here, but I would like to share my Rule #2: Always Have a Pen.  (Rule #1 is not relevant for discussion.)</p>

<p>This may seem like a silly rule, but I feel like it has been useful for me in the past few years.  Amongst others, I first got this advice from <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/%7Ecrohde/personal/">Dr. Charles Rohde</a> during his class.  He simply stated that you should always have a pen (and paper) because good ideas/quotes rarely come when you expect them and it&#39;d be a crime to forget them.  Others have good points on why to have one:
<a href="http://notesaboutnotes.com/Notes/Alwayshaveapen.html">here</a> and of course <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1bxtia/lpt_always_carry_a_pen_youll_find_you_use_it/">Reddit</a>.  You may want to skip this post and read the Reddit comments.</p>

<h2>Why I like pens</h2>

<p>Some people may ask: Why a pen? Why not carry around a pencil?  To which I respond: &ldquo;Who are you and what are you doing in my house&rdquo;.</p>

<p>But honestly, one big thing is that pencil doesn&#39;t work very well on some surfaces, especially skin.  Particularly on the back of my hand, which is the first medium I use if I have no paper.  I also break the lead in pencils all the time.  I can write as hard as I want with a pen, and it almost never breaks.  Using an eraser on a pencil pretty much turns into an infectious smudge disease that makes whole pages indecipherable.  One other thing that I realized later in life: other than people who study math, many people use pens - it just seemed more grown up.  So I like using a pen.</p>

<h2>Why I hate pens</h2>

<p>Really, the one reason I hate pens is because when you always have a pen, you sometimes wash a pen.  Note: Pens stain clothes.  This has happened to me more than once, ruining almost entire loads of laundry.  Now I check all my pockets twice before doing laundry.  I guess this practice is good training if I have to wash my children&#39;s clothes one day (or have children).  </p>

<p>But pens don&#39;t ruin clothes only when in the wash. When you put pens in your pocket, you have to make sure they are are unclicked.  I have some nice lined khakis lying around somewhere if you&#39;d like to see what I mean.  So if these are concerns or you&#39;d have an aneurysm if pen got on your pants, maybe take that pencil route.  Or carry two pens: one ballpoint, one Tide.  Or get a pocket protector.  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get a pocket protector.</p>

<h2>Ancillary Benefits:</h2>

<ol>
<li> When splitting a check, you can write down the amounts on multiple credit/debit cards.  The waiter/waitress almost never brings a pen <strong>before</strong> you give your cards, which I find as a bit of an oversight, unless they don&#39;t want you to split the check.  And I have <a href="https://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a> or <a href="https://venmo.com/">Venmo</a> to do things electronically when needed, but pens still are handy.</li>
<li> It&#39;s good when you have to write your number/email down really quick.  You can also add things to your business card (like a website or a message or Twitter handle), if you need to.</li>
<li> You look professional and have your stuff together.  Ever see that person frantically looking in their bag or asking if someone has something to write with?  Amateurs.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>You may due all your thinking 9-5 or always have your phone/computer/tablet.  I frequently have my tech gear handy and have tried to become 100% digital, yet I still use pens.  I mostly use it during off hours and when I&#39;m not in the office.  Sometimes I look like Russell Crowe from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/">A Beautiful mind</a> writing down math equations on a napkin.  I&#39;m OK with that, and much happier if I can get things down on paper (or napkin) at the time I&#39;m thinking rather than have the anxiety of forgetting it.  So if you want one quick &ldquo;improvement&rdquo; for the day, start carrying a pen.  If you already do, get a nice one - you won&#39;t be so apt to lose it.</p>
