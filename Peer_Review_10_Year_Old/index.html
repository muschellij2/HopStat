<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>I discuss how I think a peer review process could work with some general requirements of needing to review before getting reviewed.</p>

<p>(If this idea is not novel, I don&#39;t really care. I just thought about it this morning and I want to blog about it. If you&#39;ve any more comments/links that&#39;ll be great.)</p>

<h2>When I was a 10-Year-Old</h2>

<p>I couldn&#39;t really sleep this morning so naturally I started thinking about the peer review process.  What I was trying to think back to is in school when did an assignment and the teacher asked us to share the assignment with our neighbors and had them to grade our homework. I thought it was very interesting because I usually thought 2 things: 1) the teacher were too lazy (how wrong I was!) to grade our homework; 2) I was happy to get feedback so quickly, and it generally was less harsh grading.</p>

<h2>Back to Peer Review</h2>

<p>I was thinking how this idea could apply to a peer-reviewed journal.I think it would be interesting if whenever you submitted your paper, then the only way you get feedback is if you reviewed another paper from that journal. I think this should be interesting for a few reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li> It encourages fast feedback from reviewers. (I&#39;ll get to how this may be a bad thing).</li>
<li> You&#39;d have a large pool of reviewers.</li>
<li> Although many (if not most) academics review papers paying forward from getting their own papers reviewed, the pay forward is immediate.  Also, you don&#39;t have the option of any &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leech_(computing">leechers</a>)&rdquo; publishing in that journal.</li>
<li> It promotes the idea that one aspect of research is &ldquo;giving back&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>

<h2>How to Select</h2>

<p>You could select from a list of papers that are currently available to be reviewed and pick the one (or more) that you feel qualified to review.  You may have to give a reason why you feel qualified (or not). If you didn&#39;t feel qualified for any, then you can either pay a fee, or give fields you do feel qualified in and wait for the journal to respond.  Editors would still check the paper is in line with the journal&#39;s mission and can double check if they don&#39;t see a good fit for a paper reviewer.</p>

<h2>Caching In</h2>

<p>I like the idea that you could &ldquo;cache&rdquo; reviews so that if you (or a co-author) submitted to this journal (or a network of journal) and had more reviews than submissions, you can simply submit.  This would be useful because:</p>

<ol>
<li> Younger (i.e. students) academics would be encouraged to get into the peer review process earlier.</li>
<li> You may review if you think you have a submission in the future.</li>
<li> You know you still &ldquo;gained&rdquo; something from the review over things you currently gain from reviews, e.g. new knowledge, seeing other writing styles, etc.</li>
<li> Having a co-author that reviews a lot of papers may be more desirableto collaborate with (not a great reason, but still gives incentive to review).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Drawbacks</h2>

<p>Potential drawbacks for this system obviously exist, such as:
1.  Quality of review.  You run the risk of people trying to review too quickly or reviewing papers they are not qualified for.
2.  Using co-authors to not review papers (or not reciprocating).
3.  Some papers are competing with each other at the same time and you may get rival authors reviewing, albeit rare.
4.  Allowing people to select papers that need to be reviewed may neglect some papers that seem more involved.  (You could maybe assign these).</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>The idea may be not really hashed out and there are probably unforeseen problems, but I think this system would be interesting to try out (if not already).  The peer review process would be even moreso a &ldquo;scratch my back, I&#39;ll scratch yours&rdquo; type of process.  Also, it gives direct incentives for reviewing, which I believe is a good thing.</p>
