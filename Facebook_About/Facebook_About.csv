"","About"
"Lada Adamic","I lead the Product Science group, which is part of the Core Data Science Team. I love data, and using it to shape Facebook's current and future products, and also gleaning insights about the fascinating paths information takes through social networks. Prior to joining Facebook, I was an Associate Professor at the School of Information + Center for the Study of Complex systems at the University of Michigan. I teach a Social Network Analysis course via Coursera."
"Mike Bailey","I am an economic research scientist at Facebook and lead the economic research group within the Facebook data science team. The economic research group is a team of economists, data scientists, social scientists, and engineers conducting use-inspired research in the areas of pricing, forecasting, macroeconomics, mechanism design, auctions, and economic modeling and simulation. I am currently working with economists from NYU and Harvard to study how one<U+2019>s social network influences one<U+2019>s economic decisions including education, home refinancing and purchases, and consumption. I joined Facebook in 2011 as one of the first economists and helped build the modeling infrastructure for demand estimation and forecasting. I received my Ph.D. in economics from Stanford University and hold a B.S. in mathematics and a B.A. in economics from Utah State University. Prior to Facebook, I was a research intern at Yahoo! studying the effectiveness of targeted advertising. "
"Eytan Bakshy","I'm a researcher and member of the Economics group within Core Data Science. I do empirical research on peer effects and information diffusion in networks.
